# Unide

Remember when Vaadin was "Thinking of U and I"? That was the time
when pure Java was king and no declarative formats were to be seen.

Unide is a "U and I Designer" from the days of old. It exports the
designs into a Java project that can be built with maven. It is also
free as it is released under the MIT license.

To run the project, clone the repository, `npm install` the damned thing and
finally recite this ancient spell: `polymer serve --npm`

## Goal of the project

Currently: the user is able to produce UIs, add basic navigation and finally export the
result to a maven project as plain Java (and some CSS).

Future: the user should be able to create full applications in Unide without programming.
