UniDe
=========
Univesal Designer for UI templates.

The design of this tool follows the suckless philosophy. The user is assumed
to be capable of modifying the source to configure the tool.

The grand idea
--------------
UniDe is an universal UI designer that is targeted as a simply prototyping tool to 
lower the bar for using Vaadin Components.

The user can produce templates quickly, add navigation and finally export the
result to the platform of choice. Exportable platforms should include all
platforms supported by Vaadin Components.
